<h1>Custom ADT Code</h1>

<p>The custom ADT code that I wrote is designed to meet the following goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Object storage: The code creates a data structure that is optimized for storing large numbers of objects. This allows for quick and efficient storage of the objects, with minimal memory overhead.</li>
  <li>Storage and time complexity optimization: The code is designed to optimize the storage and time complexities of the ADT. This includes implementing data structures and algorithms that have a low time and space complexity, such as using a balanced tree rather than an unbalanced one, to ensure that the ADT can handle large amounts of data with minimal performance degradation.</li>
  <li>Manipulation methods: The code also implements and optimizes working methods to manipulate the data stored in the ADT. This includes methods for adding, removing, and searching for objects within the ADT, as well as more advanced manipulation methods such as sorting, filtering, and querying the data. These methods are designed for optimal performance and are easy to use and understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, this code is a custom ADT that is optimized for storing and manipulating large numbers of objects efficiently, with minimal memory overhead, and with easy-to-use methods for data manipulation.</p>
